Uber Everywhere is a project created by Aashay Sanghvi, Patrick Connors, and Will Smiles at Harvard University for CS171: Visualization.
All our Javascript files are included within the folder 'js'. A few external libraries we used are queue.js, leaflet.js, jQuery, and Bootstrap, which are minified and included. Within our 'data' folder, we have included all the data we used for the visualizations as csv files, some of which are borrowed from FiveThirtyEight (https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response). The remaining data is weather data we got from Weather Underground (https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KNYC/2014/4/23/DailyHistory.html?req_city=New+York&req_state=NY&req_statename=New+York&reqdb.zip=10001&reqdb.magic=1&reqdb.wmo=99999&MR=1)In our 'css' folder, we have included our custom stylesheets as well as Bootstrap, which helps with mobile responsiveness. Our html files are in the root folder.

Each of the four visualizations is interactive. For the first object (the map), press the "Start" button to engage the visualization and "Stop" to end it. With regards to the second visualization (the heatmap), use the select box to view information for different companies. The third visualization (the dynamic bar charts) also uses a select box to adapt and change it. The fourth visualization is a coordinated view linking an area chart and a bar chart. The area chart represents total precipitation and you can brush over the graph to visualize the differences in Uber pickups between that day and a not-so rainy day.
